> "Contact Improvisation is a dance form based on the communication between two or more moving bodies that are in physical contact and their combined relationship to the physical laws that govern their motion—gravity, momentum, inertia."
> - Nancy Stark Smith

> "Contact improvisations are spontaneous physical dialogues that range from stillness to highly energetic exchanges. Alertness is developed in order to work in an energetic state of physical disorientation, trusting in one's basic survival instincts. It is a free play with balance, self-correcting the wrong moves and reinforcing the right ones, bringing forth a physical/emotional truth about a shared moment of movement that leaves the participants informed, centered, and enlivened."

What is Contact Improvisation?
=====

Contact improvisation (or CI, or "contact") has always been difficult to
define, in part because it’s intentionally undefined, in part because it
continues to evolve and change.

However, one definition might be that contact improvisation is a social dance
that arises out of modern dance traditions. One of its central principles is a
rolling point of contact between two (sometimes less, sometimes more) people
through which both dancers give and share weight. It’s somewhere between tango,
modern dance, aikido, wrestling, gymnastics, and none of the above, and usually
takes place without music. People dance contact in any combination of genders,
there are no “steps,” and it’s entirely improvised.
