Contact improvisation is one of the most welcoming and friendly dance forms
that you can do. It’s for people of all body types, ages, backgrounds, and
athletic ability. We at the Los Angeles jam pride ourselves on being friendly
and open to newcomers - we love to see new people falling in love with contact
improvisation and we love beginners’ energy.

Here then is a compilation of tips, advice, and words of wisdom for those of
you starting in contact improvisation.

What is Contact Improvisation?
=====

Contact improvisation (or CI, or "contact") has always been difficult to
define, in part because it’s intentionally undefined, in part because it
continues to evolve and change.

However, one definition might be that contact improvisation is a social dance
that arises out of modern dance traditions. One of its central principles is a
rolling point of contact between two (sometimes less, sometimes more) people
through which both dancers give and share weight. It’s somewhere between tango,
modern dance, aikido, wrestling, gymnastics, and none of the above, and usually
takes place without music. People dance contact in any combination of genders,
there are no “steps,” and it’s entirely improvised.

You can find a few more definitions at contactimprov.net.

How can I start? Should I take a class?
=====

While a class can be helpful for developing good fundamentals and learning
certain advanced skills, you can start by simply doing. Show up at the LA jam
and let people know that you’re new to contact improvisation. People will be
happy to give you introductory instruction.

The Bring (or Be) a Beginner Night takes place once every month at the Los
Angeles – Santa Monica jam, at which beginners are especially encouraged to
attend and we start the evening with a class/warmup suitable for all levels.

What’s a “jam”?
=====

A CI jam is where people come together to practice and play at the
form/art/sport of contact improvisation. Though jams are as loosely defined as
CI itself, any CI jam will nevertheless likely contain the following elements:
– people
– dancing (probably mostly contact improvisation, although who’s to say?)

You may also find some of these elements: hardwood floors
-community
-socializing
-music
-performance and workshop announcements

Can I arrive late or leave early at the LA jam?
=====

Certainly. However, we do names at our opening and closing circles, so being
there at the beginning and/or end is a good way to get to know people.

What to Wear
=====

Dress comfortably in clothing that allows a free range of movement. It’s
probably better to have clothing without buckles, buttons, or large zippers, as
they can be uncomfortable to roll over while dancing. It’s usually better to
have clothing that covers the legs, since you may be on your knees on occasion.
Don’t worry about footwear; barefoot is usually the best option. (Although
sometimes people have been known to dance in socks or dance shoes, socks can be
slippery and dance shoes can accidentally squash toes, so you should be careful
if you wear either.) I typically wear sweat pants, a T-shirt, and a long-sleeve
T-shirt over that while warming up.

Avoid large dangly pieces of jewelry; they can get caught on or under
something, which can be awkward and/or dangerous. If you need to tie your hair
back, I recommend doing so with something soft — a scrunchy or rubber band
instead of a hair clip.

What Else to Bring
=====

Expect to sweat a fair bit, so you may want to bring a change of clothes.
There’s filtered water at Dance Home, so there’s no need to bring any.
Experienced contacters often wear Chinese kneepads, which are thinner than
typical kneepads and allow more range of movement. However, you should be able
to get through your first jam without any (and some long-time dancers don’t
wear them at all). If you want to be super-prepared, you can order kneepads
through the Contact Quarterly.

What to Expect
=====

Every jam is a little bit different. However, a typical jam experience at the
Los Angeles jam might go something like this:

The jam “officially” starts at 6:30 with an “opening circle,” which consists of
a brief introduction and greetings. Sometimes, that will be followed by a class
on some aspect of contact improvisation or by a “group warmup” for those who
want to participate.

Often, individuals will continue to arrive throughout the evening. Most dancers
take some time to warm up by themselves when they first arrive, using whatever
routines work best for them. Over the course of the next two-and-a-half hours,
people will join in and out of dances. Most of these will be duets, but
occasionally—and often towards the end of the night—some contacters will dance
in trios or larger groups. In between “partner dances,” many dancers will
continue to improvise, stretch, and dance on their own.

Without music, it is up to the dancers to determine when they’ve arrived at an
ending to their dance. There have been times when this writer has danced all
night with only one or two others or has preferred to “solo” all night, but by
and large, one can expect to have at least three to four different dances over
the course of an evening. A short dance might last less than five minutes,
while a particularly long dance might last over thirty minutes. Every now and
then, a single duo or trio might dance together for the entire jam, but this is
rare.

At the LA jam, we almost always end the evening with a “closing circle” and an
exchange of names, after which, folks often go someplace nearby to eat or
drink.

What Are the Weirdest Parts of Contact Improvisation?
=====

Well, there’s contact. Lots of it, with no specified gender combination. While
all of that contact can theoretically be a bit difficult to deal with, in
practice most people acclimate to it rather quickly. If you find yourself in a
situation where you’re uncomfortable with the amount or type of contact,
consider communicating this to your partner, either verbally or non-verbally.

Socially, some aspects of contact improvisation can be difficult for those new
to it, precisely because there is no set etiquette or rules. Beginners
sometimes look for the rules that tell them when they’re doing things “okay”
and when they’re not. The only rule is that each dancer is responsible for
his/her own safety and comfort.

How Do I Ask Someone to Dance?
=====

There is no set etiquette for asking someone to dance. At the LA jam, the
majority of dances probably start as the result of someone verbally asking
someone else to dance. But dances also start in many other ways. Sometimes
dancing next to an individual or duo will result in a dance, as will wordlessly
making contact with someone who is already moving in a “dancerly” way.
Sometimes, a chance collision between different sets of dancers will result in
a change of partners.

Of course, just like asking outright, sometimes these methods don’t result in a
dance. However, by and large, most people are at the jam to dance and
appreciate any opportunity to do so.

When Does a Dance End?
=====

A dance ends... when it ends! You and/or your partner agree on when to end the
dance. There is no wrong or right time to end a dance, and no wrong or right
way to end a dance. Be aware of when you might want to stop, be sensitive to
your partner, and end the dance when you think it should end. Dances can last
(and have lasted!) from ten seconds to all evening.
